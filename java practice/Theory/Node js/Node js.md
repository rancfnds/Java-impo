### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Unlike traditional JavaScript, which is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers, Node.js extends the capabilities of JavaScript to be used for server-side programming.

### Why is Node.js Used?

Node.js is used for a variety of reasons, making it a popular choice for developers. Here are some key reasons:

1. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**:
   - Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it suitable for handling multiple concurrent connections efficiently. This is particularly useful for building scalable network applications.

2. **Single Programming Language**:
   - Developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, which simplifies the development process and allows for code reuse.

3. **High Performance**:
   - Built on the V8 engine, Node.js compiles JavaScript into machine code, resulting in high performance. Its event-driven architecture also allows for efficient handling of I/O operations.

4. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**:
   - Node.js comes with NPM, a package manager that provides access to thousands of open-source libraries and modules.
